          <h2>Now this one is for the lazy ones!</h2>
          <h3>3. Auto rename tag</h3>

          <p>Now let's say you created an H1</p>

          <img class="thumbnail" src="Screenshots/Auto rename tag example.PNG">

          <p>And you want to change it into a h3 now you can do it the old way to first go to here and make it an h3 and
            then doing it same for the other one. So this is really boring and when you have a lot of tags it becomes a
            problem that's why meet the AUTO RENAME TAG - </p>
